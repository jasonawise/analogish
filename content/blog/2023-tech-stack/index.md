Well since we are off to a running start in 2023 I thought I might introduce my tech stack I am using to start the year off. There are a mix of analog and digital tools here.

For me the one thing that really holds everything together is my bullet journal. Its a very simple A5 Exceed Dot Notebook from Walmart. My journal is where I time block my day, list tasks that need to completed today. It also allows me to put my fleeting notes here also. It is also with me for the most part so most of my notes get filtered through that. I also do most of my personal journaling through Day One.

Not far behind my journal is my iPhone 13 Pro Max, it also goes everywhere with me, for better or worse. I have Drafts on my phone and when I am not around my journal this is where my fleeting notes go so I can process them later. Has of this moment this is where I also do most of my social media. I also have the Kindle the app here where I read about half of my digital books.

Next is my 2020 M1 Macbook air. This is where I do my programming at, whether using VSCode or Xcode based on what I am working on all of my programming is done on this machine. This is where I also process my notes from my journal and Drafts into Obsidian. Obsidian also servers as my PKMS and where I am going to try to write most of my stuff in the future.

I also have a Kindle ereader where I spend most of the rest of my time reading digital books.
